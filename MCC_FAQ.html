          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>Why should my child participate in the Bright Minds Math Competition Club (MCC)?</h3>
          <p>Math competition club is an enrichment activity which challenges students to build logical and analytical reasoning skills, get creative, and use the tools they have been given in an unfamiliar environment. Whether they ever intend to participate in a formal competition is immaterial.</p>
          <p>This is a skills-building activity that can be attended by anyone interested. These sessions are available to all students at no cost to you. It is an excellent way to greatly enrich your child’s math education.</p>

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>We provide competition forms for students to work out at home and submit prior to each session. Questions that the students found most challenging will be reviewed during the training session.</p>
          <p>We learned in previous years that having the students work on the competition form ahead of time proved to be a winning strategy. Students got SO much more out of the training having attempted to solve the questions in advance.</p>
          <p>In order to attend, the student MUST work on the contest form that will be discussed on the coming weekend, and solve it to the best of their ability. It is OK to not answer a question if the student has no idea how to do it. The whole point of the kids solving ahead of time is for them to get familiar with the questions, and for the instructors to know which questions we should go over.</p>
          <p>The student MUST send us their answers via the ZipGrade website no later than the evening prior to their scheduled session.</p>

          <h3>Are MCC sessions online or in-person?</h3>
          <p>All MCC sessions are online via Zoom. Please only attend after attempting the contest questions and submitting your answers.</p>

          <h3>Is there a cost to attend MCC sessions?</h3>
          <p>No, MCC sessions are optional and available to all Renert School and Bright Minds students at no cost.</p>

          <h3>Does my child need to attend all MCC sessions?</h3>
          <p>No. MCC sessions are optional and for enrichment purposes. There is no need to commit to all sessions. You can choose to participate in as many (or as few) as you like.</p>

          <h3>Can you run MCC sessions on different days/times so my child can attend?</h3>
          <p>No, sessions are scheduled based on instructor availability and we are unfortunately unable to run them on different days/times.</p>

          <h3>Can I help my child with the questions at home?</h3>
          <p>If you have a young child, you can help them read the questions and perhaps with some vocabulary they are unfamiliar with. Beyond that, it's best to see what they can do on their own. The important thing is that they attempt the questions even if they are unsure how to get the correct answer.</p>

          <h3>Can we see the answer key for the contest questions?</h3>
          <p>Yes, answer keys will be poseted for access <em>after the session ends</em>.</p>

          <h3>If we can not attend a session, do you do make-up sessions?</h3>
          <p>No, we can not facilitate make-up sessions. The answer keys will be posted online after the session date. If your child would like help with solving a problem or two, they can attend Homework Help sessions and ask for assistance there.</p>

          <h3>Can my child attend more than one session?</h3>
          <p>Students can attend one level up or down based on their comfort level. They may join multiple sessions so long as they have completed the contest questions as required for each session they wish to attend.</p>

          <h3>Who do we contact if we have more questions?</h3>
          <p>Email <a href="mailto:tutoring@renert.com"><strong style="color:#ff0000">tutoring@renert.com</strong></a> or call <a href="tel:+15873921115"><strong style="color:#ff0000">587-392-1115</strong></a>.</p>
