Certain contests are invitation-only by the organizer (based on performance on other contests): AHSMC II, CMO Repechage, CMO, AIME, and COO. Notice that some contests will run during school hours while others will have to be taken in the testing centre after school.

<b>Q: How do I register for a contest?</b>

A: Your child's math teacher will ask their students if they wish to participate in a particular contest if they believe it is within their ability level. Certain contests are written by all students of particular grades (see below). 

<b>Q: Which contests will all students write?</b>

A: The Beaver Computing Challenge (grades 4-6), CESMC (grades 4-6), Gauss (grades 7-8), Pascal (grade 9) will be written by all students in those grades.

<b>Q: What about the Math Kangaroo?</b>

A: The Math Kangaroo is not a contest which schools compete in. Instead, individuals compete and thus must register on their own. You can find more information <a href="https://mathkangaroo.ca/en">here</a>.

<b>Q: What about the AMC 8?</b>

A: At this time, Renert School does not participate in the AMC 8, partially because it is a difficult competition that does not lead to any invitations for more advanced competitions. 

<b>Q: What if my child does not do well on a contest?</b>

A: No one should feel bad about performing poorly on a contest, as long as they give it their best effort. Everyone has their off days, and no one should have to compare themselves to others.
