Every day from Saturday, December 21, 2024 to Wednesday, January 1, 2025, there will be a new set of math puzzles for you and your family to enjoy. Each set consists of three levels of difficulty. There will be a raffle each day to determine the winner, where tickets are given out based on which levels you answer correctly: level 1 earns 1 ticket, level 2 earns 2 tickets, and level 3 earns 3 tickets. This means you can earn up to 6 tickets in one day by correctly solving all three levels!

The puzzles will appear on this website each day before 9:00AM MST of that day, and you have until <b>11:59PM MST of the same day</b> to submit your answers using this form (valid for every day except day 6): <a href="https://forms.gle/hJ4musNYtw4Esxzn9">https://forms.gle/hJ4musNYtw4Esxzn9</a>

Note that an answer submitted on the wrong day (even by minutes or seconds) will not be considered by the system. 

<!--
Answers will appear on this page in the week of January 8, 2025. Until then, feel free to puzzle out any levels you missed (no submission necessary).
