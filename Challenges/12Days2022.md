Every day from Friday, December 23, 2022 to Tuesday, January 3, 2023, there will be a new set of math puzzles for you and your family to enjoy. Each set consists of three levels of difficulty. There will be a raffle each day to determine the winner, where tickets are given out based on which levels you answer correctly: level 1 earns 1 ticket, level 2 earns 2 tickets, and level 3 earns 3 tickets. This means you can earn up to 6 tickets in one day by correctly solving all three levels!

The puzzles will appear on this website each day before 9:00AM MST of that day, and you have until 11:59PM MST of the same day to subit your answers using this form: https://forms.gle/8kLAUVSHCZCfKWT28

Day 1 (Friday, December 23, 2022): Check back later!
