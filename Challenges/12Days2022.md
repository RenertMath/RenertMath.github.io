Every day from Friday, December 23, 2022 to Tuesday, January 3, 2023, there will be a new set of math puzzles for you and your family to enjoy. Each set consists of three levels of difficulty. There will be a raffle each day to determine the winner, where tickets are given out based on which levels you answer correctly: level 1 earns 1 ticket, level 2 earns 2 tickets, and level 3 earns 3 tickets. This means you can earn up to 6 tickets in one day by correctly solving all three levels!

The puzzles will appear on this website each day before 9:00AM MST of that day, and you have until 11:59PM MST of the same day to submit your answers using this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/8kLAUVSHCZCfKWT28">https://forms.gle/8kLAUVSHCZCfKWT28</a>

Answers will appear on this page in the week of January 9, 2023. Until then, feel free to puzzle out any levels you missed (no submission necessary).
