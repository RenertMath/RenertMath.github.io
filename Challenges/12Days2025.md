Every day from Saturday, December 20, 2025 to Wednesday, December 31, 2025, there will be a new set of math puzzles for you and your family to enjoy. Each set consists of three levels of difficulty. There will be a raffle each day to determine the winner, where tickets are given out based on which levels you answer correctly: level 1 earns 1 ticket, level 2 earns 2 tickets, and level 3 earns 3 tickets. This means you can earn up to 6 tickets in one day by correctly solving all three levels!

The puzzles will appear on this website each day before 9:00AM MST of that day, and you have until <b>11:59PM MST of the same day</b> to submit your answers using this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/7H3YZAS4sjgsB2VR9">https://forms.gle/7H3YZAS4sjgsB2VR9</a>

Note that an answer submitted on the wrong day (even by minutes or seconds) will not be considered by the system. 

Thanks for participating! Answers and winners will be released after the winter break. Until then, feel free to puzzle out any levels you missed (no submission necessary).

<!--
Answers will appear on this page in the week of January 8, 2025. Until then, feel free to puzzle out any levels you missed (no submission necessary).
