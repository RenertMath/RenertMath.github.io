### Renert pi Day challenge 2021

The finals will take place on Monday, March 15 during your normal math class. Finalists will compete in their classrooms, with their teacher checking digits. To be a finalist, you must be in the top 10 of your grade (K through grade 6) or division (division 3 and division 4) during qualifiers the week before.

Rules:
- Students get 3 "strikes": a strike only counts if the supervising teacher needs to stop the student and correct them. If the student catches themselves ("3.14159, 897 - I mean 26535"), then no problem. In light of this, teachers will not immediately react to correct and incorrect digits recited, and instead give a few seconds just in case.
- In the interest of time and getting things moving, students will have up to 30 seconds to continue recitation after a pause. After 30 seconds, a gentle encouragement to give their best guess will be given, otherwise it will count as a strike.

Prizes: 
 * 1 mini-bag of skittles for every 50 digits recited
 * A Kinder egg for the first 100 digits (K-div 1) or 200 digits (div 2+)
 * 1 Kinder egg may be traded for 4 mini-bags of skittles

<!--
K - Gr 1
Gr 2-3
Gr 4-6
Gr 7-12
-->

Note: all records are counting decimal digits, rather than digits - that is, digits after the decimal place. In this way, 3.141 counts as 3 "digits".

2020 records:

 * K - Gr 1: Basil - 95
 * Gr 2-3: Jeffery - 259
 * Gr 4-6: Jeena - 525
 * Gr 7-12: Emiri - 379

All-time records:

 * K - Gr 1: Basil - 95 (2020)
 * Gr 2-3: Jeffery - 259 (2020)
 * Gr 4-6: Jeena - 525 (2020)
 * Gr 7-12: Brian - 1309 (2017)
