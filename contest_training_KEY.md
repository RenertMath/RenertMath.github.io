<b>MARINA WORKING ON THIS</b> <br>
  <b>How Does it work?</b> <br>
  
  
 *	If you are Bright MInds student: yoou access your Id in theportal xxxx. This will be the same number that yuIn order to attend, the student MUST work on the contest  will use as a zip grade ID whenever yu need to access zip grade to submit a test or to access your score xxxx



 *	If you are a Renert School student the reference number you will use is the same as you use for the cafe. You can find this number in your school profile.xxxx

We can instruct students with similar as I did in the google drive document  Student session

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G5GNhow6usE-ZGnnJEkwZAVn98YjzXFAC2jx7JEUbrA/edit

After the sessions we can publish the pdf with the access code that each student will need. I already exported the spreadsheet. We can hide the names or the ID number (maybe this is easier) So we give first, second name + access code. They still need the Id to login.

Also we need to give instructions to the instructors in how to use zip grade app. THis should be the easier part. hahahhaha
