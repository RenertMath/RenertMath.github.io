<p><strong>Math Competition Club FAQ</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why should my child participate in the Bright Minds Math competition club (MCC)?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Math competition club is an enrichment activity which challenges students to build logical and analytical reasoning skills, get creative, and use the tools they have been given in an unfamiliar environment. Whether they ever intend to participate in a formal competition is immaterial.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a skills building activity that can be attended by anyone interested. These sessions are available to all students at no cost to you. It is an excellent way to greatly enrich your child&rsquo;s math education.</span></p>
<p><strong>How Does it work?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide competition forms for students to work out at home and submit prior to each session. Questions that the students found most challenging will be reviewed during the training session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We learned in previous years that having the students work on the competition form ahead of time proved to be a winning strategy. Students got SO much more out of the training having attempted to solve the questions in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to attend, the student MUST work on the contest form that will be discussed on the coming weekend, and solve it to the best of their ability. It is OK to not answer a question if the student has no idea how to do it. The whole point of the kids solving ahead of time is for them to get familiar with the questions, and for the instructors to know which questions we should go over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The student MUST send us their answers via the zipgrade website no later than the evening prior to their scheduled session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can attend one session up or down based on their comfort level and they may join multiple sessions so long as they have submitted their answers for each session they wish to attend.</span></p>
<p><strong>Are MCC sessions online or in-person?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All MCC sessions are online via zoom.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please only attend after attempting the contest questions and submitting your answers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is there a cost to attend MCC sessions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, MCC sessions are optional and available to all Renert School and Bright Minds students at no cost.</span></p>
<p><strong>Does my child need to attend all MCC sessions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. MCC sessions are optional and for enrichment purposes. There is no need to commit to all sessions. You can choose to participate in as many (or as few) as you like.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can you run MCC sessions on different days/times so my child can attend? We are busy during the session time on the schedule.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, sessions are scheduled based on instructor availability and we are unfortunately unable to run them on different days/times.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can I help my child with the questions at home?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a young child, you can help them read the questions and perhaps with some vocabulary they are unfamiliar with. Beyond that it's best to see what they can do on their own. The important thing is that they attempt the questions even if they are unsure how to get the correct answer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Can we see the answer key for the contest questions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you will have access to the answer key and your child's answers via zipgrade </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the session ends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>If we can not attend a session, do you do make-up sessions?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we can not facilitate make up sessions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The answer keys will be available via zipgrade after the session date. If your child would like help with solving a problem or two, they can attend Homework Help sessions and ask for assistance there.</span></p>

<p><strong>Can my child attend more than one session?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can attend one level up or down based on their comfort level. They may join multiple sessions so long as they have submitted their answers for each session they wish to attend.</span></p>
