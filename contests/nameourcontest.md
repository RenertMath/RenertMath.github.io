			 <b>The Renert Rabbit</b> elementary school math contest. <br><br>This is both in recognition of the industrious nature of the rabbit, a quality we endeavour to cultivate in our students, and also in honour of the so-many rabbits that populate the Renert School grounds and reside under the Bright Minds portables. <br><br>Thank you, Evan Haney, for coming up with this name, that was selected from among dozens of excellent ideas
