			 <b>The Renert Rabbit</b> elementary school math contest. This is both in recognition of the industrious nature of the rabbit, a quality we endeavour to cultivate in our students, and also in honour of the so-many rabbits that populate the Renert School grounds and reside under the Bright Minds portables. Thank you, Evan Haney, for coming up with this name, that was selected from among dozens of excellent ideas.

	   Name Our New Math Contest and WIN $50*!!
	Renert Elementary School Math Contest is searching for a name that is more catchy than “RESMC”. 
	         With a view of having the RESMC held annually for many years to come, we are looking for a good, catchy name, that will embody the love of math, the love of problem solving and of self improvement. 
	     <br>
	Other math contests are called Kangaroo, Beaver, Caribou, Gauss, Pascal….
			 <br>
