         You may register your child whether or not they attended any of the training sessions over the past 4 Saturdays.
         Please do not enrol your child if they do not wish to participate. Math contests should always be voluntary. 
       <br><br>  Deadline for registering is midnight on Friday, March 26. <br>Fill out a separate form for each child who wishes to participate.
         Only those that fill out the form will receive instructions regarding how to receive and print the competition form, proctor, and submit the answers (which will come on Saturday). 
  It is best to have a working printer and to print out the questions so students work off of a paper copy.
         Parents will get access to the contest form 15 minuets prior to 3:00 pm on Saturday. </li>
         <br>
The length of the contest is 45 minutes long for grades 1-3 and 60 minutes long for grades 4-6.
<br> <br>
All contestants will get a Certificate of Participation, and our strongest ones will get Certificates of Distinction, as well as prizes. Winners, and prizes for top performers will be announced within a week following the competition.
