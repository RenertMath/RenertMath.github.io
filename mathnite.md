Renert Math Nite is inspired by the Math Nite put on by the University of Calgary, and is a few hours of working through mathematical challenges. Like its namesake, Renert Math Nite will be geared toward Grades 9 to 12, although exceptional and sufficiently mature students from earlier grades are welcome. As a rule of thumb, students attending should have a good grasp of basic algebra. Parents and teachers are welcome to observe and/or take part, and we especially encourage it if the student is younger. 

This session will take place at Renert School on Wednesday, May 3, 6:00PM-8:00PM, in room 2514/2515. Please register <a href="https://forms.gle/whvTsigCQ9SuaodSA">here</a> for logistical purposes.
