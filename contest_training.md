Bright Minds Math Competition Club (MCC) is back for the 2022-23 school year and will be running sessions for interested students starting this weekend!<b>
 
How Does it work?
We provide competition forms for students to work out at home and submit prior to each session. Questions that the students found most challenging will be reviewed during the training session. Only students that work on the competition form and submit their answers prior to their session will be sent the Zoom access information for the upcoming training session. We learned in previous years that having the students work on the competition form ahead of time proved to be a winning strategy. Students got SO much more out of the training having attempted to solve the questions in advance.
•	In order to attend, the student MUST work on the contest form that will be discussed on the coming weekend, and solve it to the best of their ability. It is OK to not answer a question if the student has no idea how to do it. The whole point of the kids solving ahead of time is for them to get familiar with the questions, and for the instructors to know which questions we should go over.
•	The student MUST send us the GoogleForm Bubble Sheet (link above) the evening prior to their scheduled session with their solutions in order to participate in the weekend session.
•	When there is more than one child per household attending, each student should submit the form with their solutions.
•	Please submit a SINGLE form per student. Multiple entries are unnecessary.
Email tutoring@renert.com with any questions you may have - but kindly review ALL points above before doing so.
