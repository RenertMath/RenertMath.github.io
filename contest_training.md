<b>Math Competition Club (MCC) <font color="red">is back!</font></b> for the 2024-25 school year <br><br>

<b>How does it work?</b>
<br>
 *	 In order to attend upcoming MCC sessions, students MUST work on the contest at home in advance and submit their answers prior to the session. <br>
For each session there will be a link to the contest that the student will be working on during the session. This will be found under the link ONLINE TEST.Through this link the student will submit his answer to the instructor. A PDF copy also will be available in case you want to print it.
 *	It is OK to not answer a question if the student has no idea how to do it. The whole point of the kids solving ahead of time is for them to get familiar with the questions, and for the instructors to know which questions we should go over. <br>
